# Seven Nation Army {#intro-intro}




Some text randomly pulled from playlist: 

Lyrics by White Stripes

Seven Nation Army
The White Stripes
I'm gonna fight 'em all
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
And the message coming from my eyes
Says leave it alone
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera for evermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me go back home

## My Mathematical Mind


by Spoon

I want to change your mind
Said I want to set it right this time
I'm looking through you
You know who you are
And planning for the apocalypse
Is not considered
Considered cool
I don't suggest it myself
But no I won't sweat
I want to change your ways
Said I'm gonna get it right one of these days
And I'm looking through you
Riding the brakes
Bringing about the apocalypse
Is not considered
Considered cool
Still you go setting it up
But never give it a thought
Just go setting it up
My mathematical mind can see the breaks
So I'm gonna stop riding the brakes
No no no no more ride the brakes
Instead I'm gonna see your stakes
Yeah I'm gonna see the stakes
